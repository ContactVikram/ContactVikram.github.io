                    Welcome to our fundraiser dedicated to shedding light on the experiences 
                    of individuals living in the Tijuana border camps. In the midst of challenging circumstances, the people in these 
                    camps have stories to tell—stories of resilience, hope, and the pursuit of a better future. Our mission is to 
                    amplify their voices, providing a platform for these narratives to be heard and understood.</p>
